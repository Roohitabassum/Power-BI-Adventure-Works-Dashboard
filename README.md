# Power-BI-Adventure-Works-Dashboard
STAGE 1: Connecting & Shaping Data

In this stage, I focused on building automated workflows to extract, transform, and load our project data using Power Query. I explored common data connectors, storage modes, profiling tools, table transformations, and more:


Data connectors

Storage & import modes

Query editing tools

Table transformations

Connected to a database

Extracted data from the web

Utilized QA & Profiling tools

Used text, numerical, date & time tools

Applied rolling calendars

Created index & conditional columns

Performed grouping & aggregating

Pivoted & unpivoted data

Merged & appended queries

Utilized data source parameters

Imported Excel models



STAGE 2: Creating a Relational Data Model

In stage 2, I reviewed data modeling best practices, introduced topics like cardinality, normalization, filter flow, and star schemas. I began to build our AdventureWorks data model from the ground up:



Reviewed database normalization

Designed fact & dimension tables

Established primary & foreign keys

Considered star & snowflake schemas

Managed active & inactive relationships

Analyzed relationship cardinality

Handled filter context & flow

Applied bi-directional filters

Structured model layouts

Defined data formats & categories

Established hierarchies



STAGE 3: Adding Calculated Fields with DAX

In stage 3, I introduced data analysis expressions (DAX). I created calculated columns and measures, explored topics like row and filter context, and practiced applying powerful tools like filter functions, iterators, and time intelligence patterns:



Differentiated between DAX and M

Utilized calculated columns & measures

Explored implicit, explicit & quick measures

Outlined measure calculation steps

Used DAX syntax & operators

Applied math & stats functions

Employed conditional & logical functions

Utilized the SWITCH function

Worked with text functions

Applied date & time functions

Utilized the RELATED function

Applied CALCULATE, FILTER & ALL functions

Utilized Iterator (X) functions

Applied time intelligence patterns



STAGE 4: Visualizing Data with Reports

Stage 4 was about bringing our data to LIFE with reports and dashboards. I reviewed data viz best practices, built and formatted basic charts, and added interactivity with bookmarks, slicer panels, parameters, tooltips, report navigation, and more:



Reviewed data viz best practices

Utilized a dashboard design framework

Created cards & KPIs

Constructed line charts, trend lines & forecasts

Formatted on-object formatting

Utilized table & matrix visuals

Applied conditional formatting

Implemented Top N filtering

Utilized map visuals

Applied drill up, drill down & drillthrough

Worked with report slicers & interactions

Implemented bookmarks & page navigation

Used numeric & fields parameters

Customized tooltips

Imported custom visuals

Managed & viewed roles (RLS)

Designed mobile layouts
